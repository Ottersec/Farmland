About:
======

Ident is an application and service fingerprinting library used within Intrigue Core.

The Ident project has a few stated goals:
 - To deeply identify network service and app software while remaining extremely fast - limiting unnecessary requests
 - To have the most complete set of identification checks for modern application and server software
 - To integrate well as a library, for easy use in other projects such as Intrigue Core
 - To maintain a robust command line interface for use as a standalone tool
 - To be commercially viable through use of the BSD license

 Ident is written in Ruby and uses the lightning fast libcurl-backed Typhoeus and the powerful Socketry libraries to make requests.

 Below, find instruction on how to get stated:

Using ident via Docker image:

For Check Writers:
===================

Check types can be written against supported protocols:
 - AMQP
 - Apache Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast (Raw)
 - Cisco Smart Install
 - DNS
 - Elasticsearch
 - FTP
 - Ganglia (Raw)
 - HTTP / HTTPS
 - Memcached (Raw)
 - Mongodb
 - Mysql
 - Oracle IIOP (Raw)
 - Oracle T3 (Raw)
 - Pop3
 - RDP (Raw)
 - Redis
 - SAP NI (Raw)
 - SMB
 - SMTP
 - SNMP
 - SSH
 - Telnet


Generally speaking, checks have the following structure. This is a check for HTTP and HTTPS:
```
 [
        {
          type: "fingerprint",
          category: "service",
          vendor: "Some",
          product: "Product",
          website: "https://www.somewhere.co.uk/",
          match_logic: :all,
          matches: [
            {
              match_type: :content_title,
              match_content: /The Title of the Page/i
            },
            {
              match_type: :content_body,
              match_content: /any body string/i
            },
            {
              match_type: :content_code,
              match_content: 200
            }
          ],
          description: "just an example check",
          paths: [ { path: "#{url}", follow_redirects: true } ]
        }
      ]
```

There are many types of matchers, which tell the check what part of the target's response to check.
```
 - content_body: checks should be run against body
 - content_code: checks should be run against code returned in the response as an integer (note that this is generally only useful for follow-on checks)
 - content_cookies: checks should be run against the set-cookie: header (do not include the header name, just the content when writing checks)
 - content_generator:  checks should be run against text inside the <meta generator> tag (do not include the tag when writing checks)
 - content_headers: checks should be run against response headers (assumes one string of text, each header '\n' delimited)
 - content_title: checks should be run against text inside the <title> tag (do not include the tag when writing checks)
 ```

Multiple matches per check are supported, see: https://github.com/intrigueio/intrigue-ident/pull/87
